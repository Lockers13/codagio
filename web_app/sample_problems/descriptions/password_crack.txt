Challenge - A .txt file of password hashes dumped from a database leak just got posted 
on the darkweb, and now it is up to you to try and crack some passwords (Lucky for you, the hashes are not salted!).
A precompiled list of commonly used passwords has been supplied for 
you in the 'data' variable, and you must search through this list,
in order to determine, for each password, whether or not its md5 hash 
occurs in the leaked .txt file. To do this, create an empty list, and for each password 
in the supplied data append a string of the following form to this list:

"{password} True/False"

Obviously, the choice between True or False will be determined by whether or not the password's hash occurs in the dumped hash file...

At the end return the fully populated list so we can see which passwords have been cracked successfully by your algorithm!

Note that the hash file is a .txt file containing one unique md5 hash per line, so it must be read accordingly.

In the editor, you are allowed to import the following modules to complete this task:

- hashlib

Finally, It should be noted that efficiency is key here, as both the supplied list of passwords and the hash file are large in size!

Good luck!
