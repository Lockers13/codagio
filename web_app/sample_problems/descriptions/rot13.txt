Challenge - write a function which takes as its sole parameter a list of randomized alphabetic ascii strings
and for each string in the list prints the original string together with the result of applying the classic
Rot13 cypher to it, viz.:

hello : uryyb

Exception handling must be implemented for the following cases:

1. If the input item is not a string, the print the item together with the message 
"Error, input is not a string", viz.:

["a", "b", "c"] : Error, input is not a string

In the editor, you are allowed to make the following imports to complete this task:

- from string import ascii_letters

Good Luck!
