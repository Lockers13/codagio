Challenge - write a function which takes a list of hexadecimal strings as its sole parameter,
and for each string in the list prints the original string together with its decimal value
in the following format, e.g.:

0xAF : 175

Exception handling must be implemented for the following cases:

1. If the string passed to the function does not begin with the characters '0x',
then print the string together with the message "Error: does not begin with a leading '0x'", viz.:

934 : Error: does not begin with a leading '0x'

2. If the string does begin with the characters '0x', but is not in valid hexadecimal format
then print the string together with the message "Error: invalid characters", viz.:

0x12FQ2 : Error: invalid characters
