Challenge - write a function which takes a hexadecimal string as its sole parameter and returns its corresponding integer value.

Exception handling must be implemented for the following cases:

1. The string passed to the function does not begin with the characters '0x'
(On exception return the string  "Error: the provided string does not begin with a leading '0x'")
2. The string does begin with the characters '0x', but is not in valid hexadecimal format
(On exception return the string  "Error: the provided string contains invalid characters!")

Good Luck!
