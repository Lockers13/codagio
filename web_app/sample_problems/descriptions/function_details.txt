Challenge - Write a function which takes a .py script as its sole argument and returns a dictionary having as keys the line number of each function occurring in the script, and as values a string containing the corresponding details about that function.

String contraining function details should be of the following form:

"function_name-function_visibility-function_parameters"

Note: all function parameters should be recorded in the form of a comma separated string, i.e.: "param1,param2,paramN"...so an example of a complete entry into our function detail dictionary might look as follows:

{17: 'get_info - public - info_dict,node'}

or again:

{24: '__shorten_url - private - url,param_list'}

We will leave it to you to determine what exceptions need handling in order to arrive at the correct output.

In the editor, you are allowed to import the following modules to complete this task:
