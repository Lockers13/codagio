Challenge - write a function that takes as its first parameter a list of commonly occurring english words,
and a configuration object (hashmap) as its second argument.

In the config object (which is a dictionary) there is a 'url' field.
Make a GET request to this url, which will return the text of a well known classic novel.

Parse the text returned and record the frequency of occurence of each word in the text.
Then iterate through the list of provided words, and for each word in the list, print the word itself,
together with the frequency with which it occurs in the text, viz.:

happy : 25
together : 13

If the word does not occur in the text, set its frequency to 0.
